                    Back in 2003 I graduated from TAFE with a Diploma in I.T - Software Development.  I then went on to work at the Environmental Protection Agency for 4 years on their helpdesk and assisted with their roll out of Windows 2000 across all of QLD.  I went on to work in Desktop Support as well as Executive Support.<br>
                    I then went back to university and studied Exercise Science for 4 years with some units of Behavioural Psychology.
