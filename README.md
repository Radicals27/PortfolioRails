# Outline:

## Purpose
The purpose of this website is to display my skills and progress as a web developer. This is by not only placing content I have made, but also in the design of the website itself.

The goal was for prospective employers or fellow developers to see all of my work in one place.

It was first published on the 2nd April 2020 during a web development course at Coder Academy Brisbane.

## Functionality / features
The website features extensive accessibility features such as descriptive alt tags for images, a minimal, functional layout of each individual page, a simple navigation bar and an easy-to-follow flow of content.

The entire website is quite responsive to adjustment. CSS styling has allowed me to adjust elements and containers as the size of the browser changes, dynamically adjusting to whatever size the user needs.

The website is as clear and easy to use on mobile (all devices) as it is on a tablet or desktop device.
